JetBrains uses this **swot** repository to grant free licenses for JetBrains tools to students and teachers worldwide. If your email is in one of the domains listed in this repository, you may request your free license from JetBrains. Visit http://jetbrains.com/student to request!

`lib/domains` directory contains a hierarchically structured list of email domains belonging to educational institutions. The domains are mostly owned by colleges and universities, and also by groups of schools united together because they are sharing the same email domain between several institutions, such as Township High School District 211 of Cook County, Illinois.

**Please notice that some email domains were abused in the past, and we don't trust them now**. The list of such domains is in the file https://github.com/JetBrains/swot/blob/master/lib/domains/abused.txt. If you are a student with email address in an abused domain, please request your free license with GitHub or ISIC authentication at **GitHub** or **ISIC** tabs at https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students. Teachers can request their licenses with their official documents, too (**Official Document** tab at https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students.

## Which educational institutions can be added to the repository?

Your pull request for adding a new email domain to the repository will be satisfied if all of the conditions below are met:

1. The domain is used by an educational institution, which offers at least one long-term course (one year or longer), and the course is somehow related to IT (it is in computer science, software engineering, statistics, bioinformatics, etc.)

2. The educational institution is a physical entity with student attendance and recognized as providing a learning curriculum for the educational system, or the institution is an accredited online educational organization providing their students with: (1) online courses with a curriculum at least one year long, (2) a dedicated email address which is provided to students only until their graduation.

**NOTE:** If an organization provides primary or secondary education only (i.e., no high or higher education programs), it will not be included in the list. Primary and secondary school students do not usually need access to professional developer tools, and if they learn some programming, we are glad to offer them Community versions of the tools, such as PyCharm Community Edition, to use which are free to everybody.

If you represent a primary or secondary school and you are certain of the necessity of a professional version of a JetBrains tool for your school, please contact JetBrains sales team via https://www.jetbrains.com/support/sales/

## How to add a domain to this repository

Adding a domain (e.g., `highlands.edu`) automatically includes all its subdomains (e.g., `student.highlands.edu`). Do not add subdomains separately â€” only the main domain is needed.

### Steps to Add a Domain: ###
1. Fork this repository. Please use a correct Fork link on GitHub
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21acc808-2fbd-4f66-a934-19f3b342736c)
2. Create a file. Each domain is represented by a single `.txt` file in the repository. Example: to add `unaab.edu.ng`, create the file `lib/domains/ng/edu/unaab.txt`. Files must have the `.txt` extension.
3. Write the official name of the educational organization on the first line of the file. It is recommended to use the name in the native language. For example, the file `lib/domains/ng/edu/unaab.txt` has to contain a line in it: *"Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta"*. Other lines may optionally contain other names the university is known by, for example the name of the school in English. For domains shared by multiple institutions (e.g., a school district), please add a word `.group` as the last line.
4. [Submit the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

We review the requests, and usually it takes three business days.
   
#### How to add the domain quicker
> We merge pull requests manually and check the information which you have provided us with before merging it.
> Thus, if you wish to make the verification process easier for us and therefore much quicker, please mention the following in your comment to the request:
> * the university official website URL, if it is different from the domain you are submitting
> * a URL of a page on the official website where a long-term (>1 year) IT related course is offered by the university
> * a URL of a page or some other proof (.pdf or a screenshot are OK) showing that the university recognizes the domain which you are submitting as an official email domain for the enrolled students.

## How to change a domain in this repository

## FAQ
#### There are many domains in my university, how can I add all of them?
If all the domains used for teachers' and students' email are in the same upper-level domain, you can add the upper-level domain. For example, if there is a domain `joedoe.org` owned by a university, and there are subdomains such as `stud.joedoe.org` and `prof.joedoe.org`, used by the students and the teachers respectively, you can add `joedoe.org` domain only, and both students and teachers will be able to request their free licenses.

However, if the upper-level domain is also used by alumni, research staff, and other people who do not participate in education directly, we encourage you to add separate subdomains, if it is possible.

If the university uses several email domains in different upper-level domains (for example, `euroacademia.ee` and `euroacademia.eu`), please submit several files with different paths and the same content (i.e., same name of the university) in your pull request.

#### Some universities have their names duplicated in the first and the second line in the respective .txt file in this repository. Shall I put the university name twice in my .txt file to have the domain added?
No, it's not needed. However, nothing bad happens if you do it, don't worry. It does not affect our decision on your request.
